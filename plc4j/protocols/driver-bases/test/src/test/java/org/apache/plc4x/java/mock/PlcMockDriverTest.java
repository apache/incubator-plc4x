     * Some application code which uses the same Connection String will then automatically get the same connection
     * and operate against the same {@link MockDevice} without the necessity to also mock field queries or other things.
     * <p>
     * In this example the {@link #someCodeWhichShouldDoPlcManipulation(String)} function represents the Business Logic
     * which should be tested and where only the connection string is manipulated for the test.
