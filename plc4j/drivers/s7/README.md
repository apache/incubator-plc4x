# S7 Driver

## Siemens LOGO

The S7 driver supports communication with Siemens LOGO devices, if the S7 communication is enabled.

However the implementation seems to be not as advanced as the normal S7 devices. 
In case of an unexpected message, the PLC doesn't resond with an error message, but it just closes the connection without and error message.
Therefore we need to provide the type of controller as part of the connection string.

A valid Siemens LOGO connection string looks as follows:

   s7://10.10.64.21/0/0?controller-type=LOGO
   
By specifying the controller-type, the driver doesn't try to read the CPU Services Data.
