==============================================================
Apache PLC4X 0.4.0
==============================================================

This is the first release of Apache PLC4X as top-level project.

New Features
------------

- The PlcConnection now supports a `ping` method to allow checking if an existing connection is still alive.
- Support of the OPC-UA protocol with the `opc-ua-driver`.
- Other Languages Support:
-- Added first versions of a C# .Net PLC4X API (`plc4net`)
-- Added first versions of a Python PLC4X API (`plc4py`)
- Added an Interop server which allows to relay requests from other languages to a Java Server

Incompatible changes
--------------------

- ElasticSearch example was updated to use ElasticSearch 7.0.1, this might cause problems with older Kibana versions.

Bug Fixes
---------


==============================================================
Apache PLC4X (incubating) 0.3.1
==============================================================

This is a bugfix-release, that fixes some problems with S7 driver.

Bug Fixes
---------

- The S7 driver didn't correctly handle "fill-bytes" in multi-item read-responses and multi-item write-requests
- PLC4X-83: fixed NPE when reading odd-length array of one-byte base types
- PLC4X-82: renamed flags "F" to Siemens Standard "M" (Marker)
- PLC4X-84: Fixed a bug in the DefaultS7MessageProcessor which didn't correctly merge together split up items


==============================================================
Apache PLC4X (incubating) 0.3.0
==============================================================

This is the third official release of Apache PLC4X.

Some new features have been added (e.g. plc-scraper) multiple
new integrations are included (apache-karaf, apache-calcite)
and a lot of (technical) refactoring has been done to prepare
future work on adapters in different languages.

New Features
------------

- Object PLC Mapping (OPM) now has a Alias Registry to allow
  variable substitution at runtime and write support
- New module `plc-scraper` for applications that have to
  scrape a lot of sps fields with high frequency
- New integration `apache-karaf` to enable plc4j in a karaf
  runtime environment

Incompatible changes
--------------------
- The 'plc4j-core' module has been merged into 'plc4j-api'.
  So there is no 'plc4j-core' module anymore. Just remove that
  dependency.
- The driver artifact names have changed so if you were using
  a `plc4j-protocol-{name}` you now need to change this to
  `plc4j-driver-{name}`

Bug Fixes
---------

PLC4X-75    Fixing dependency to the wrap url-handler
PLC4X-76    When receiving responses with more than 512 byte,
            the IsoOnTcp protocol doesn't work
PLC4X-77    When the last item in a request is a DINT, the
            DefaultS7MessageProcessor dies
PLC4X-78    Write operations seem to fail
-           Fixed a Bug where S7 was not able to read arrays.


==============================================================
Apache PLC4X (incubating) 0.2.0
==============================================================

This is the second official release of Apache PLC4X.

Especially have we addressed all issues reported during
our first release, that were of non-technical nature.
These were tracked in:

PLC4X-60	Fix findings by the last release

New Features
------------
A new connection-pool was added, which allows automatic
pooling and reuse of PLC connections.

A new OPM module was added, which allows JPA like read-
communication using POJOs, very similar to JPA.

A stub of a new driver for the Emerson DeltaV protocol
has been added, but is not yet a fully functional PLC4X
driver. This is also a first test of our new `passive-
mode-driver` concept.

Incompatible changes
--------------------

We have refactored the API in order to eliminate the
need of passing `x-requests` to `x-methods` and added
an `execute` method to each request type. This greatly
simplifies the client code. However this requires
refactoring of applications using the direct PLC4X API.

Miscellaneous changes
---------------------

We have increased the test coverage greatly and fixed
a lot of little errors we found on the way.

Known Issues
------------

Bug Fixes
---------

PLC4X-56	[S7] S7Field does not recognize addresses
            with numElements present
PLC4X-57	[S7] Response for address with numElements
            contains only first item
PLC4X-61	Installation fails plc4j-protocoll-ethernetip
            needs license
PLC4X-62	Modbus results deliver null-Value due to missing
            implementation of getShort, getLong ...



==============================================================
Apache PLC4X (incubating) 0.1.0
==============================================================

This is the first official release of Apache PLC4X.
It contains drivers for the following protocols:
- Siemens S7comm (0x32)
- Beckhoff ADS
- Modbus
- EtherNet/IP

However the Siemens driver definitely is the most
mature driver, the rest should be treated experimental.

New Features
------------

PLC4X-29	[S7] Implement PDU Fragmentation
PLC4X-39	Extend the Edgent integration with the new Subscription features of PLC4X

Incompatible changes
--------------------

- NONE -

Miscellaneous changes
---------------------  

- NONE -

Known Issues
------------

- NONE -

Most drivers should be treated experimental and are not near production ready.
The S7 driver is probably the furthest implemented and tested driver and hereby can be 
considered to be the most mature.

Bug Fixes
---------

PLC4X-20	Jacoco doesn't seem to be working at all
PLC4X-21	Code coverage doesn't seem to work
PLC4X-47	S7 driver silently ignores surplus ReadRequestItems
PLC4X-48	S7 driver failes to parse response with multiple items
