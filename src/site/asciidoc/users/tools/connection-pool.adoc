== Connection Pool

There are situations where you don't want to carry around connections in your code.

For example if you have a microservice application, you might have multiple services accessing PLC data.

Keeping an open connection for each of these is rather problematic as in contrast to modern computers, PLCs usually are only able to manage a small number of concurrent connections.

I think a Siemens S7-1200 is limited to 7 concurrent connections and a Siemens LOGO can't do more than 3.

One alternative would be to open and close the connections all the time.
This however puts an unnecessary stress on the PLCs as for protocols like the S7 or the ADS protocol a handshake of multiple requests and responses has to be executed before being able to communicate.

As usually these services only require ad-hoc access to a PLC, it would be ideal to share connections between services.

Another problem occurs when you open a connection and keep it open for a prolonged time period.
Here it can happen quite often that a connection is terminated because the PLC has been turned off.

Per default the PLC connection has no means of automatically re-connecting.

The `PooledPlcDriverManager` can help you with both of these scenarios.

=== The PooledPlcDriverManager

The `PooledPlcDriverManager` is a wrapper around the normal `PlcDriverManager`.

The main difference is that as soon as a connection is requested, it will look if one already exists and return that.

If no connection exists it will create a new one and keep it in the pool.

There are no API differences from using the normal `PlcDriverManager` so you call `createConnection` and `close` just like with the normal PLC4X API.

The structure of the code is now more or less like if you would create a new connection for every request and close it afterwards.

Another benefit of the `PooledPlcDriverManager` is that it will check a connection for any problems before returning it to the client.

So if a connection was terminated, it will detect this and create a new connection.

=== Example

Here comes a little example program utilizing the `PooledPlcDriverManager`:

[source,java]
----
    PlcDriverManager driverManager = new PooledPlcDriverManager();

    // This just simulates a scenario where a lot of connections would be created and immediately destroyed again.
    for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        try(PlcConnection connection = driverManager.getConnection("...")) {

            ... do something ... (please refer to the PLC4J getting started for details)

        }
    }
----

NOTE: When sharing connections between multiple services, be sure to share the instance of the `PooledPldDriverManager` as otherwise you will result in having multiple pools.

=== The CachedDriverManager

There's an another version of pool manager with similar target but different implementation. 

The idea behind this second pool driver is that a connection could be lost for a lot of external reason and without the possibility to restore that (i.e. the cable is unplugged in a reading session after the query by the plc4x library but before the PLC response came back). In this Pool Manager every connection could be used for only a limited period of time, at the end the connection is no more valid and must be returned to the poll. 

Even in this schema like in the previous one , getting a connection from the pool is effortless so the typical live cyclo of a connection is: 

```
Get a connection from the pool -> use the connection before the expiration -> return the connection to the pool
```

In the previous example, if the PLC answer doesn't come back to the library, a watchdog will invalidate the open connection at the end of it's live time and the library could continue to talk to the PLC with some other connections fetched from the pool. 

Let explain this concept in more detail using the Cached Pool in the previous example

[source,java]
----
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String connectionString = "s7://192.168.1.192";
            PlcDriverManager manager = new PlcDriverManager();
            PlcDriverManager cached = new CachedDriverManager(connectionString,() -> manager.getConnection(connectionString));
            for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                try {
                    try (PlcConnection conn = cached.getConnection(connectionString)) {
                        if (conn.isConnected()){
                            PlcReadRequest.Builder builder = conn.readRequestBuilder();
                            builder.addItem("PollingValue", "%DB1:4.0:BOOL");
                            PlcReadRequest readRequest = builder.build();
                            PlcReadResponse syncResponse = readRequest.execute().get(2000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
                            printResponse(syncResponse);
                        } else {
                            logger.info("PLC is not connected, let's try to connect");
                            conn.connect();
                        }
                    }
                    TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(500);
                } catch (PlcConnectionException e){
                    logger.error("Connection exception in trying to reconnect", e);
                    TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(500);
                } catch (CancellationException  e){
                    logger.error("Polling Thread canceled", e);
                    TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(500);
                } catch (IllegalStateException e){
                    logger.error("Error in Netty state machine", e);
                } catch (ExecutionException e){
                    logger.error("Interrupted Exception fired", e);
                } catch (TimeoutException e) {
                    logger.error("Timeout exception fired", e);
                }
            }
        System.exit(0);
    }
----

In this snippet of code there are some considerations that are worth to be underlined.

* The `try-with-resources` statement (i.e. ``try (PlcConnection conn = cached.getConnection(connectionString))``) ensure that after the use of the connection, this will be automatically closed and returned to the pool. As said before if the connection get stuck for any reason after a fixed amount of time will be killed by a software watchdog (i.e. the amount of time is now fixed to 5000 ms, will be configurable in the future)
* Check if the PLC is connected before reading some data is always advisable (i.e. ``conn.isConnected()``) but this doesn't mean that the PLC will be ready to answer to the connection, it means that the initial handshake was good and plc4x has the needed information to talk with the PLC;
* the use of get must be done with a timeout (i.e. ``readRequest.execute().get(2000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)``). After the timeout amount of time a `TimeoutException` will be fired. In the code this will be trapped and recorded just a simple line of log. This case could happen because the PLC for some reason could decide to not answer or the physical connection could have some problem;
* the `PlcConnectionException` is a connection error that cold happen in the handshaking phase between the PLC4x library and the PLC. It's a generic error.
